# ICL using preference dataset
This project is a modification to the paper "Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning". In this work, we have used preference data instead of normal dataset and analysed the results. 
# Usage

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure to have the version of torch compatable with your cuda driver version.
